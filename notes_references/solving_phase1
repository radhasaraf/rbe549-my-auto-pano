Need to learn:
-------------
* ANMS 
* subsampling methods for feature descriptor
* computing homography given feature points
* RANSAC steps 

Highlights:
----------
* 40 X 40 centered patch in feature descriptor
* blending techniques and third party code can be used
* algo should work for any number of images
* no/less number of matches then algo should ignore that from final panorama
* if all images have no/less number of common features then error
* Poisson blending to account for inconsistency during blending

Phase 1 Parameter tuning:
-----------------------
* resizing image
* N_best in N_best corners of ANMS
* Gaussian blur parameters for feature descriptor
* threshold for (best match distance)/(second best match distance)
* threshold for categorzing feature correspondences as inliers in RANSAC
* N_max number of iterations in RANSAC or thresholding percentage for number of inliers
